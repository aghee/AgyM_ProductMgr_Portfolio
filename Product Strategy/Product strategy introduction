Developing product strategy
Idea generation - The team comes up with new product ideas via market research on current trends and competition, focus group discussions with actual customers, and internal brainstorming from across the company.
Idea screening - The team then prunes the initial list of ideas to be more realistic. At this stage, the product team screens ideas using criteria such as marketing potential, risks involved, the technical feasibility of the new product, and how it fits into the overall business strategy.
Concept development and testing - The next stage is where the team turns ideas with the most potential into actual concepts by defining the product's target market, price, features, and benefits. After that, the team tests those concepts on potential customers to get feedback.
Business analysis and market strategy - At this stage, a business analysis helps figure out possible profit, expected costs, and sales forecasts. Alongside this, you need to develop the market strategy to nail down how the company will promote, price, and position the new product.
Product development - Here is where you actually build the product or new feature. Depending on the project management methodology used, this could involve developing a prototype or minimum viable product and doing continuous testing to get the product ready for launch.
Test marketing - Once the team develops the product, it tests the product on a small market to get feedback from potential customers and identify any problems.
Product launch - Here the company launches the final product to the full market â€” that process includes making it available for purchase, promoting it to the public, and providing support.
