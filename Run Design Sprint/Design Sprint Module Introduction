Running a design sprint
A design sprint is a five-day process (time frame may vary) for validating product ideas through collaboration, prototyping, and user testing. The steps for running a design sprint are: 
Understand - Build a knowledge base about the challenge
Define - Form a strategy or plan based on the team's ideas and data
Sketch - Create variants and sketches
Decide - Choose a direction or concept
Prototype - Create a mockup or prototype
Validate - Test the prototype with a small number of users
Principles of a design sprint
Together alone - Design sprints encourage silence to harness the power of collaboration
Tangible discussion - Everything is captured in a design sprint
Everyone has a voice - No one is left behind
Strict time boundaries - Design sprints follow a structured schedule
